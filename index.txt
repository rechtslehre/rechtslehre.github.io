I & You, *or*: Recognition and The Virtue of Justice
====================================================


Our topic has both a moral and practical-philosophical aspect, and a
metaphysical aspect. Under the first heading, I am thinking we need to
understand the distinctiveness of the idea *X wrongs Y* and the
possibility of posing most of the central questions of 'moral
philosophy' in terms of it, rather than in terms of the 'moral ought',
'moral obligation', even if much is nevertheless left to be treated by
such an approach. But a proper solution will involve developing some
material on the first person, and a slowly developing literature on the
second or first-and-second person.



Some Readings on the 'moral' aspect of the material
---------------------------------------------------

### Joel Feinberg,

-   [The Nature and Value of Rights](second-person/feinberg.pdf)

### Elizabeth Anscombe,

will be of interest to us in a number of ways. Her paper, or
editorial, or whatever it is - "Modern Moral Philosophy" - should be
read by all. Of crucial interest is the undeveloped preference for the
concepts *justice/injustice* (understood as a 'virtue' concept)

-   [Modern Moral Philosophy](http://www.pitt.edu/~mthompso/mmp.pdf)

### Yvgeny Pashukanis,

-   [General Theory of Right and Marxism, ch.
    III](https://docs.google.com/fileview?id=0B9jlScR8SHVgMzU4ZTJkZjktM2JjMi00MDkxLWJiNTUtOTcyM2E5ODA5NDYx&hl=en)
-   [General Theory of Right and Marxism, ch.
    IV](https://docs.google.com/fileview?id=0B9jlScR8SHVgM2Y2NDVlM2EtODQ3My00ZThlLWIzYWMtZDA4ZTFjZTVmZmQ1&hl=en)

> It should be kept in mind that the idea appearing here as 'law' is
> understood as *jus/ ius/ to dikaion* , else the whole discussion makes
> no sense. Though he thinks that this sort of relation only comes into
> being with systems of exchange, he thinks that it precedes, in every
> sense, the state and legal systems properly speaking.

### Giorgio del Vecchio,

### Michael Thompson,

There is one (quasi-)proper paper and a few slides and notes available
on this topic:

-   [What is It to Wrong
    Someone?](http://www.pitt.edu/~mthompso/raz.pdf)
-   [What we think of each other
    (unruly slides)](http://www.pitt.edu/~mthompso/i+you.pdf)


Aristotle

Jackson's peculiar translation and edition of *N.E.* Bk V is old enough
to be available in the public domain.

I have extracted the English -- which, as I said, leaves 10 or so Greek
words in Greek (one would prefer a transliteration, of course) --

An immense selection of works on associated topics was employed by the 'second person' seminar in Berlin in 2010. I link some of the readings [here](readings.html
